# DataStructuresImplementation
C++ implementation of some of the most well-known data structures in the simplest way. Mostly in non-OOP style because I used to teach them to my students (aged 16 - 18), So the algorithms and the performance were the main points. (I wrote these codes about four years ago, so let me know if something is wrong.)
