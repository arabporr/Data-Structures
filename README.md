# Data Structures
This repository contains C++ implementation of some primary and essential data structures, which will be taught in the data structures course.
Since I am currently the TA for this course, this repository does not contain all the course materials, and the rest of the codes will be uploaded as the course progresses.

The purpose of the codes is mainly education and computation efficiency, so I tried to avoid any unnecessary complexity in using the programming language.
