C++ implementation of some of the most well-known data structures and algorithms in the simplest way. Mostly in non-OOP style because I used to teach them to my students (aged 16 - 18), So the algorithms and the performance were the main points. 
Note: I wrote these codes about four years ago, so let me know if something is wrong. Besides, I would be happy to hear your comments and suggestions. Together We Grow!
